in order to automate the UNIONVMS-WEB deployment into Wildfly, I created the maven pom.xml.
You can build and deploy by executing:

\>mvn clean wildfly:deploy

TODO: In environment/dev.json I have paramterized the host and port like the following:
{
    "envName": "dev",
    "host":"${dev.srv.host}",
    "port":"${dev.srv.http.port}"
}
...but I haven't committed it since I would break your tests.
